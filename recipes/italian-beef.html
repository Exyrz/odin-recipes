        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Italian beef is perfect for sandwiches. It's easy to make in a slow cooker and tastes just like my all-time favorite sandwich that I used to get at a local restaurant when I lived in a suburb of Chicago.</p> <p>Serve on crusty rolls with roasted sweet or hot peppers.</p>
